## Local Setup (Once Only)

### Prerequisits

- docker
- docker-compose
- node.js >= v16.0.0

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:cressie176/node-oracledb-experiment.git
   ```
1. Run npm install
   ```
   cd node-oracledb-experiment
   npm i
   ```
1. Test the application (may take a while when first run due to database initialisation)
   ```
   npm t
   ```
1. Start the application (may take a while and report several errors when first run due to database initialisation)
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Accessing Oracle

You can get access to the local oracle container using the following properties

#### Local Application Database

| Name | Value | Notes |
| user | app_user | |
| password | test_password | |
| hostname | localhost | |
| port | 1521 | |
| service | XEPDB1 | |

#### Local Test Container

| Name | Value | Notes |
| user | test_user | |
| password | test_password | |
| hostname | localhost | |
| port | 1522 | |
| service | XEPDB1 | |

You can also exec into the running oracle containers in order to run sqlplus

```bash
docker exec -it node-oracledb-experiment-oracledb-app-1 bash

sqlplus app_user/app_password@XEPDB1
```

## Design Decisions

### Running everyting in a container

Applications which use oracle require a [local installation](https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/INSTALL.html#-3-node-oracledb-installation-instructions) of the Oracle client libraries. To avoid simplify this process, we have created docker images and a docker compose file with the libraries pre-installed, and always the application / tests from within a container for local development via docker-compose.

### Connection management

According to [the documentation](https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/doc/api.html#parallelism), the node oracledb driver connections cannot be used concurrently, but it is safe to share a connection with proper use of async/await. A low traffic application may consider creating a new connection per request, providing it is careful to always disconnect. A better alternative for low traffic applications is to use single shared connection, and tp consider what happens if the connection is closed. This application assumes that the platform will monitor it's health endpoint and restart it if the endpoingt reports that it is unhealthy. Busy applications should always use a connection pool.

## TODO

- Configure prettier to stage changes on pre-commit
- Configure the watchers to detect changes and update the app container automatically
